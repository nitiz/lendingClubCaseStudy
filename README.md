# Project Name
> It is for Lending club, which could be a finance company specializing in lending different types of loans to customers. When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision to either reject or approve the loan based on applicant’s profile. Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision:
•If the applicant is more likely to payback the loan, then not approving the loan would result in loss to the organisation
•If the applicant is not likely to payback the loan, then approving the loan may lead to bad debt and thus financial loss


## General Information

The club wants to understand the driving factors behind loan default (loan_status = 'Charged Off'), i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default. The company can utilise this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment.


## Conclusions
- Higher loan amounts result in higher default rate
- Higher interest rate has resulted in higher default rate
- Customer with high income had less loan default rates
- High debt to income ratio has resulted in higher default rates
- Loan default rate is higher for high loan tenors
